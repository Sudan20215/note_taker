The project was simply a challenging for me and I had these problems:
<li>-I was unable POST but later on I accepted the challenge and went on with it.</li>
<li>-It was simply a big task from a backend using POST,DELETE and GET.</li>
<li>-Sometimes the there was a bug and took me a lot of time see the bug I was able to address it.</li>
<li>-Altogether It was fun to do this challenge.</li>
