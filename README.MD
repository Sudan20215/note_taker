The project was simply a challenging for me and I had these problems:<li>
-I was unable POST but later on I accepted the challenge and went on with it.</li>
-It was simply a big task from a backend using POST,DELETE and GET.<li>
-Sometimes the there was a bug and took me a lot of time see the bug I was able to address it.</li>
-Altogether It was fun to do this challenge.<li></li>
